- tsne visualization
- plotly dash to browse both of the above

# Clustering

# Interactive Viewing
A interactive dash application is created to view the above. 

Sampled mnist dataset can be selected from the tnse plot (which is colored by kmeans cluster or actual labels). The images are then displayed on the right panel. Number of images can be increased if required.
